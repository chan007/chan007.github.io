Inspired by levelsio's [this post](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), I decided to take on the challenge of 12 statups in 12 months. I have basically launched 2 startups before this. Both not very successful. I have a feeling that I might be getting too emotionally invested in an idea before really considering if it has any legs. Launching quickly and checking might be the best thing to do. Also, I quickly lose interest in things. Keeping a one month deadline seems exciting. Enough of convincing myself.

Maybe "statup" is too big of a term for what I am planning to do, but anyway, lessfuckinggooo ðŸ”¥


### Startup 1: vakil.help (September)

I want to make a webiste that makes it easy for anyone (especially  laywers) to search for all documents related to the Indian law. A bit of scraping to get all the documents + RAG + LLM + some front end.
